# Flask-and-React-JS-CURD-operations-using-API-building-MySql-Database
In this we will be using Python Flask as a backend service to create API's and the data will be displayed on the frontend using React Js library.
As our backend server and frontend is running on different ports so we wil be using the CORS library of flask to make the API accessible on different ports. Notifications in React using React - Toast, React Table V6 for displaying JSON data. CRUD operations using Flask API on the MySql database with the data fetching in frontend.
Softwares used :
1) Anaconda - Flask, MysqlClient, SqlAlchemy, etc
2) Node JS - React JS - React State Hooks
3) XAMPP - Apache, MySql, Phpmyadmin

# Steps to run :

a) Backend 
1) Create a new environment in Anaconda and install all the required libraries
2) Copy all the files and run the command in terminal : python app.py
3) python server will be running on http://localhost:5000

b)Frontend
1) Create a new react app
2) Copy all the files and components give the command : npm install  to install the libraries in node modules or install required library individually.
3) Enter the command : npm start to start the frontend server, it will be available on http://localhost:3000 by default.
